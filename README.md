### Time Series Modeling of UK Birth Rate (R)

This project applies **time series analysis** to forecast future **birth rates** in the UK, using models such as **Holt-Winters**, **ARIMA**, and **ETS**. The goal is to identify the best model for accurate forecasting and support policy and demographic analysis.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Data Preparation**: Import, clean, and transform UK birth rate data into a time series format; visualize trends and seasonality.
2. **Time Series Decomposition**: Decompose the data into trend, seasonality, and residual components using STL decomposition.
3. **Model Fitting & Forecasting**: Fit **Holt-Winters**, **ARIMA**, and **ETS** models to predict future birth rates.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using **RMSE**, residual analysis, and **Ljung-Box test** for autocorrelation.

#### Outcome:
The project aims to identify the most accurate forecasting model for UK birth rates to aid in demographic planning and policy decisions.
